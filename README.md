8 puzzle game using React. 

Key techniques include: 
- functional-based components and passing value between them. 
- React hooks are used to manage states. 
- Fisher–Yates algorithm is implemented to randomly shuffle the puzzle tiles with equal probability. 

Future extension: Apply the A* algorithm to find the optimal solution automatically.
