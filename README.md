# 8-puzzle
I implemented the 8 puzzle game using React. Key techniques include functional-based components and passing value between them. React hooks are used to manage states. Fisherâ€“Yates algorithm is implemented to randomly shuffle the puzzle tiles with equal probability.  Future extension: Apply the A* algorithm to find the optimal solution automatically.
